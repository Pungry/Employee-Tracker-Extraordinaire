## Description

This is a command-line interface program that allows users to create a database of employees without having to do much of the boring setup. Simply by answering a few prompts, an SQL database will be created, making an easy to parse list of departments, roles, and employees. 

## Installation

After downloading the code, type "npm install" into your terminal in order to download all dependencies for this program. You should also paste the SQL commands in the seeds.sql file into your SQL workbench in order to create the initial database.

## Usage

To begin the program, type "node server.js" into your terminal. If it has properly booted up, a question asking if you'd like to view your database of employees, or add/edit a new employee/role/department. The department list is the keystone, so you should start by adding a new department if the seeds.sql department list doesn't have the one you want. Then make some roles for those departments, and finally add some employees.
